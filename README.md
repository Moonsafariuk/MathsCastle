# MathsCastle
Maths Castle/ Castle Maths is a short text-based maths adventure game designed and created as part of my college course.

It may take a few moments to load as it is around 50mb and was not originally intended to be a web game. 

The game was created in Unity3D combined with Visual Studio, which allows for better debugging. C# was used as the scripting language as there was the potential that the game might need to be developed further in the future to be compatible with an Access database.

The game was planned and created around a given situation and required a game design documents (high game design and game treatment) along with user documentation. 

This repository contains some of the documentation submitted and the code from the Unity3d build.
